Nanowire simulator using cylindrical coordinate

This simulator includes 2D Poisson solver, 2D Continuity equation, 1D Schrodinger Solver.

Couple the Poisson solver and Continuity equation = Classical DD model

Couple the Poisson solver and Schrodinger solver = Schrodinger-Poisson Solver

Couple the Poisson solver, Schrodinger solver and Continuity equation = Quantum DD model

This simulator using Robin type boundary to simulate the surface potential, we do not explicitly simulate the oxide.
