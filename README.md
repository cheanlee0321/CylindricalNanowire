Nanowire simulator using cylindrical coordinate

This simulator includes 2D Poisson solver, 2D Continuity equation, 1D Schrodinger Solver.

Couple the Poisson solver and Continuity equation = Classical DD model
Couple the Poisson solver and Schrodinger solver = Schrodinger-Poisson Solver
Couple the Poisson solver, Schrodinger solver and Continuity equation = Quantum DD model
