Nanowire simulator using cylindrical coordinate

This simulator includes 2D Poisson solver, 2D Continuity equation, 1D Schrodinger Solver.

Couple the Poisson solver and Continuity equation > Classical DD model
Couple the Poisson solver and Schrodinger solver > Schrodinger-Poisson Solver
Couple the Poisson solver, Schrodinger solver and Continuity equation > Quantum DD model

> Reference : A 2-D3-D Schr√∂dinger-Poisson Drift-Diffusion Numerical Simulation of Radially-Symmetric Nanowire MOSFETs

This simulator using Robin type boundary to simulate the surface potential, we do not explicitly simulate the oxide.
